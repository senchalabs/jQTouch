jQTouch
=======

Create powerful mobile apps with just HTML, CSS, and Zepto.js (or jQuery).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

jQTouch is a JavaScript plugin which works with either Zepto.js or jQuery, and comes with smooth animations, navigation, and themes for mobile WebKit browsers (as found in iOS, Android, BlackBerry, and WebOS).

- [Easy to install](http://wiki.github.com/senchalabs/jQTouch/gettingstarted). Get up and running in a few minutes.
- [Entirely customizable](http://wiki.github.com/senchalabs/jQTouch/initoptions) with selector options
- [Theme support](http://wiki.github.com/senchalabs/jQTouch/themingstyling), including default Apple and jQTouch custom themes
- [Callback functions](http://wiki.github.com/senchalabs/jQTouch/callbackevents) throughout, including swipe and orientation change detection
- Page history management and CSS3 page transitions, including 3D flip, cube, and swap
- Failover to 2D animations for devices that don't support 3D
- Easily allow apps to run in fullscreen mode with custom icons and startup screens
- The power of jQuery to build AJAX applications
- New demos: Clock and Todo

## Upcoming Features
*Note: Upcoming features are developed in the master branch, and are not to be considered stable. For official releases, please see the [version tags](https://github.com/senchalabs/jQTouch/tags).*

- [Zepto](https://github.com/madrobby/zepto) integration - Use with Zepto.js instead of jQuery to cut down on precious bandwidth. Zepto.js is very similar API to jQuery, but optimized for WebKit and thus about 20kb smaller.
- Sass-based stylesheets, easily modified with variables, and optimized for size.
- Image-less stylesheets -- Using [Compass Recipes](https://github.com/senchalabs/compass-recipes), we have recreated all of the gradients and background patterns with CSS. This way, they are resolution independent, dynamically theme-able, and lower bandwidth.

[Source code](http://github.com/senchalabs/jQTouch/archives/master), [issue tracking](http://github.com/senchalabs/jQTouch/issues), and [documentation](http://wiki.github.com/senchalabs/jQTouch/) are available on github.
